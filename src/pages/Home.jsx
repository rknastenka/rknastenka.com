                        Hey stalker, welcome to my blog. i'm Bana. "ini" is just a nickname i love,
                        if you wanna pronounce it just read this phrase: "eye and eye".
                        anyway, so here you'll see a bunch of unscripted perceptions of mine,
                        i mostly post my thoughts and notions about different random topics
                        as i'm free as my thoughts allow me to be. get your cup of tea and enjoy reading
                        dear passenger.

                    i wouldn't say i'm a web dev master nor a hardware grinder,
                    i'm a jack of all trades, master of some. i'm a fast learner
                    that's for sure, i do and act the way my cuorsity leads me to,
                </p>

                    a brief explanation about my <a href="projects.html">projects</a>
                    &nbsp;and the way i make them,
                    i’ve had this problem forever, and if you’re reading this
                    and facing the same matter, please just read these lines.
                    originality doesn’t mean first, to be original you just have to be yourself
                    find a problem you face and solve it, there’s always gonna be someone who thought about the same
                    solution 8 years ago, so don’t let that let you down
                    just do what you love, do it the second you think about it
                    do not let your ideas drown over time
                    trust me, we all have brains; you’re not the only smartie
                    with great ideas in the room, even that person you believe is
                    an absolute retard has some ideas in his head.
                    what really matters is action! like bro fuck your ideas
                    show me some results, show me what you did, show me how you
                    implement it. publish your MVP, get some feedback,
                    as mark zuckerberg once said: “ideas don’t come fully formed, they become clear as you work on
                    them.” so
                    stop making excuses for yourself. just stop waiting for
                    the right time, right place, right UI/UX or whatever.
                    just start…
                    that’s all i can say.
                    just start.

                        myself in all the skills I want. And why do I want? I want to
                        live and feel all the shades, tones and variations of mental
                        and physical experience possible in my life. And I am horribly limited." </p>
