                a brief explanation about my <a href="/projects">projects</a>
                &nbsp;and the way i make them,
                i've had this problem forever, and if you're reading this
                and facing the same matter, please just read these lines.
                originality doesn't mean first, to be original you just have to be yourself
                find a problem you face and solve it, there's always gonna be someone who thought about the same
                solution 8 years ago, so don't let that let you down
                just do what you love, do it the second you think about it
                do not let your ideas drown over time
                trust me, we all have brains; you're not the only smartie
                with great ideas in the room, even that person you believe is
                an absolute retard has some ideas in his head.
                what really matters is action! like bro fuck your ideas
                show me some results, show me what you did, show me how you
                implement it. publish your MVP, get some feedback,
                as mark zuckerberg once said: "ideas don't come fully formed, they become clear as you work on
                them." so
                stop making excuses for yourself. just stop waiting for
                the right time, right place, right UI/UX or whatever.
                just start…
                that's all i can say.
                just start.
            </p>

                    to search for the truth. Have holy curiosity.
                    Make your life worth living."
