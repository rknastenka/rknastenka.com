      Whom you are is a very controversial question to ask.
      for me, a soul is introduced and formed within its perspectives
      and acts upon its lifetime, we as humans are very similar, 
      we're pieces of bone and marrow.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      what makes you, you. 
      is a consequence of replicated deeds that were built upon the life 
      and thoughts you grew up in. these thoughts of yours may be 
      altered until they're fully formed one day, but the core is 
      the same for everyone, you grew up to be like your surrounding
      or whom you call your family. 
      These five first years breathing of yours,
      which you can't recall a memory of, are the ones who made 
      you who you are today.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      no matter how much you try to change,
      you can never change the roots of a tree; you only blend it
      with other leaves to make it better. and your goal should
      be being the best you could ever be. never coping with anything that doesn't align with your perspectives.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    it's more about the time you spend understanding yourself to get where you somehow specify your next step, and you're barking the wrong tree if you believe it's social media that's holding you back. when in fact, it's just you.

     during the past years, the truth had dawned on me. i now avow the verity that has always lain between my lines of complaint. we've all been in a lifelong run, chasing answers and seeking to get somewhere we're not in. trying to do everything whilst indeed doing nothing. yet i can't affirm my purpose, but i do, in some way, acknowledge my intentions. Hence, beyond my beliefs, which i may or may not achieve, i wish to perceive more about the sky and moon and what's in between.

     I'm bana btw, mostly known as nastenka or ini, choose the one that lingers with you. Anyway, welcome to my blog. Here you'll see a bunch of unscripted perceptions of mine, i mostly post my thoughts and notions about different random topics as i'm free as my thoughts allow me to be. get your cup of tea and enjoy reading dear passenger. Go through my notes, read my articles, and decide for your own what kind of a soul you think i am.

    "What if laziness is nothing but a habit of thinking about the effort instead of thinking about the outcome?
    What if you could reverse laziness by simply developing a habit of thinking more about the delicious food that you'd like to enjoy
    instead of how long it would take you to get up and go get it?
    But the real question is, if you were to test this at home and try to see if you can think more about the good outcome
    and less about the work, would you get it done?
    Why is it that people have a second child?
    Why does a woman who goes through this awful, awful childbirth have a second child?
    Don't they always say the same thing?
    If I remembered how bad this was, I wouldn't do it again.
    Right?
    So the not thinking about the effort is vital to actually the survival of humanity.
    If we focused on how hard it was to have a baby, you just wouldn't do it.
    Or you do too little of it.
    But if you focus on how awesome it would be to have a family, well, there you go."
