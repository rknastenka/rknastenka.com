    date: 'November 13, 2023',
    content: `Are we obliged to lie,
to pretend, to show the sight?
Standing on the edges of hell,
shall we fall, or grab the flame?
Either way, we burn.
Choices are never made
you take a devil’s breath
to stand in this old yard of men,
on standards they were built.

Why do we have to pretend?
To show, to scream, to get.

Why do we have to pretend?
To be, to dress, to fit.
Why do we have to pretend?
Why can’t humble be enough?

Why do we have to pretend?
To steal a soul of steel,
to burn and call it gain.

I’m scared. I want to be me.
But who am I to be?
Am I the one you see?
I'm scared of you to judge,
the words of which meant it all.
I don’t scream for you to hear
but who the fuck sees?
The beauty everyone carries
why can’t it be seen?

Why do we have to pretend?
Is it so hard to get?
Open the rims of your face,
hear what I’ve shouted for years.
Why do we have to pretend?
Ignoring us till we break,
forcing us to be someone you love.

Maybe then you’ll see
see the world you built.
And now you ask: is that me?
Should I keep lying,
or keep the one you seek?

Why do we have to live
with a stolen soul you took?
Is that me, I asked.
Thoughts rip through my brain.
No, it’s mine.
If it’s broken, it’s still mine.
Because I am a strewn man.
Look what you’ve made.

Who am I, I asked.
I don’t know, I replied.`

    content: `I saw the fear
the fear of losing, the fear of hearing,
a frozen tree reminding me to shrink,
while the urge to hold on pulled me near.

Forgiveness was the only cure.
An era when eyes widened,
when truth refused to hide,
when voices spoke of meaning
some understood, but few felt the weight.

We shut our ears, our eyes,
just to survive.
Mocking those sins,
yet never naming the hands that shaped them.
Doubting even what is seen
denial stronger than belief.

Facts were never kind companions.
Some drew closer,
but many wandered too far to return.

A liar as Disney was,
no story ends in light.
No happy ending waits for you, my dear.`

  feeling the ugliest i’ve ever felt
i can’t get dragged down again
i was sober for too long
now i can’t avow the ache i sense
i thought it was real, as i always did
i don’t wanna obtain the victim’s mindset
though darkness is all around my head
i’m too stupid for this world
maybe it’s a sign from god
maybe i should get my ass up
maybe i should be better, do better

i tried, god i tried
none in my hands
it’s not always what it looks
feeling the ugliest i’ve ever felt
i whispered my love
maybe it’s me in the end
maybe i am the problem
feeling the ugliest i’ve ever felt
cause i got your eyes away from me
i told you, you weren’t listening
i don’t get this life
it’s harder than it seems
yes it’s true but you weren’t
none of you is
feeling the ugliest i’ve ever felt
you kissed my lips and i dreamed of a life you’re in.

    content: `
    The pawn reached the border.
But he had to sacrifice the rook, the bishop, the queen, and every other pawn.
Now he sits as a king, living only on those sacrifices
and with them, a memory half-erased,
scarred by the trauma he poured upon himself.

He thought he would be a king
just by moving forward, crushing everything before him.
But when the pawn reached the edge,
he faced the truth:
a pawn can never be a king.

He sat alone in the majestic chair,
wishing to level up.
The other pawns had risen,
now they watch from far away,
staring at the aura he trapped himself in.
He cannot even define whom he is.

The knight stood to protect his friend.
He came closer
but he could not recognize
the creation in front of him.
The knight flipped the table
and chose to start a new game.

The greedy pawn ran the other way.
He erased everything and kept running.

He met another pawn.
But this pawn was lonely.
He needed friends.

Time passed.
Fate dragged him under the mercy of the new pawn.
And he was sad,
because he still wanted to run.

But what he couldn't see

you can run, but you can never hide. `
