    content: `I saw the fear
the fear of losing, the fear of hearing,
a frozen tree reminding me to shrink,
while the urge to hold on pulled me near.

Forgiveness was the only cure.
An era when eyes widened,
when truth refused to hide,
when voices spoke of meaning
some understood, but few felt the weight.

We shut our ears, our eyes,
just to survive.
Mocking those sins,
yet never naming the hands that shaped them.
Doubting even what is seen
denial stronger than belief.

Facts were never kind companions.
Some drew closer,
but many wandered too far to return.

And liar as Disney was,
no story ends in light.
No happy ending waits for you, my dear.`

    title: 'Why Do We Have to Pretend',
    date: 'November 13, 2023',
    content: `Are we obliged to lie,
to pretend, to show the sight?
Standing on the edges of hell,
shall we fall, or grab the flame?
Either way, we burn.
Choices are never made—
you take a devil’s breath
to stand in this old yard of men,
on standards they were built.

Why do we have to pretend?
To show, to scream, to get.
Why do we have to pretend?
To be, to dress, to fit.
Why do we have to pretend?
Why can’t humble be enough?
Why do we have to pretend?
To steal a soul of steel,
to burn and call it gain.

I’m scared. I want to be me.
But who am I to be?
Am I the one you see?
I’m scared of your judgment,
your word that meant it all.
I don’t scream for you to hear—
but who the fuck sees?
The beauty everyone carries—
why can’t it be seen?

Why do we have to pretend?
Is it so hard to get?
Open the rims of your face,
hear what I’ve shouted for years.
Why do we have to pretend?
Ignoring us till we break,
forcing us to be someone you love.

Maybe then you’ll see—
see the world you built.
And now you ask: is that me?
Should I keep lying,
or keep the one you seek?

Why do we have to live
with a stolen soul you took?
Is that me, I asked.
Thoughts rip through my brain.
No—it’s mine.
If it’s broken, it’s still mine.
Because I am a strewn man.
Look what you’ve made.

Who am I, I asked.
I don’t know, I replied.`
