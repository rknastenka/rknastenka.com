      'If you focus on the good, you\'ll encounter the good. If you focus on the bad, you\'ll encounter the bad. It\'s not because only one exists -both are always present- but because your perspective decides what stands out. it\'s about your pov to the world and how you observe it, you must carve happiness out of everything, the bad before the good. if you learn to see the good in the bad, you\'ll always be happy, you got laid off from work, smile maybe it\'s not the right place for you. One misconception that i must point out, is that "seeing happiness in the so called \'bad events\'" doesn\'t mean not fighting for the things you really want. don\'t surrender easily but fight happily.',

      'Happy people aren\'t always the richest, nor the poorest, nor the ones with good health. Happy people are those who wake up and choose to smile through it. They aren\'t the only ones who face struggles, everyone feels like an \'I\'ve-got-the-worst-life\' person sometimes. for some of which are happy, some of which chose to blame it on life. life was never fair upon the eyes of a fragile human, so stop comparing your life to your friend\'s. you\'ve got your battles and i can assure you, they do have their ones too. one argument says that "No, if I had their battle, I wouldn\'t be as sad as they are." "i wish i had that battle instead of mine". Dear human, it wouldn\'t be called a "battle" if you don\'t lose your insanity dealing with it. it\'s as simple as that, God knows that event-x wouldn\'t be a battle for you, so he gave you event-y, not because god doesn\'t love you, but because he knows better the test subject you should be graded upon.',

These five first years breathing of yours, which you can\'t recall a memory of, are the ones that made you the person you are today. no matter how much you try to change, you can never change the roots of a tree; you only blend it with other leaves to make it better. and your goal should be being the best you could ever be. never coping with anything that doesn\'t align with your perspectives.',
