It\'s not because only one exists -both are always present- but because your perspective decides what stands out. it\'s about your pov to the world and how you observe it, you must carve happiness out of everything, the bad before the good. if you learn to see the good in the bad, you\'ll always be happy, you got laid off from work, smile maybe it\'s not the right place for you. One misconception that i must point out, is that "seeing happiness in the so called \'bad events\'" doesn\'t mean not fighting for the things you really want. don\'t surrender easily but fight happily.',

"i wish i had that battle instead of mine". Dear human, it wouldn\'t be called a "battle" if you don\'t lose your insanity dealing with it. it\'s as simple as that, God knows that event-x wouldn\'t be a battle for you, so he gave you event-y, not because god doesn\'t love you, but because he knows better the test subject you should be graded upon.',

    'Remember that question we all got as kids, what do you want to be when you grow up? most kids said doctor, teacher, designer. when i was asked, i said, a scientist. and someone asked me, what kind? so i said, a physicist. then later, a quantum researcher. then later, an astrophysicist. i was confused about the title i should give myself, but that was the problem. it took me years to realize i wasn\'t chasing physics, i was chasing understanding. what i loved wasn\'t just equations, it was discovery, the process of learning something new. the word physicist was just a title on the map, but the map to my big purpose was what guided me all along. labels can point you somewhere, but they\'re not the journey. your big purpose, your goal, is the journey.',
